## Branch Naming Convention 
In order for artfiacts to be published to the Terraform registry, branches must follow the formats shown below:
```
x.y.z-example-branch
```
```
x.y.z.q-example-branch
```
This is so the version can be extracted from the branch name and be used to create git tags which are required to generate binaries and create releases.
